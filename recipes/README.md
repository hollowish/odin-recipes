This is a very basic recipe website, created to satisfy the requirements of an Odin Project lesson about basic HTML coding.

The website demonstrates learning the following skills:
  *Creating an html document using appropriate boilerplate header info
  *Linking pages to allow navigation between them using <a href=""> tags
  *Using basic html tags, such as <h1>,<p>, <li>, <ul>, and <ol> to design a simple heirarchy of page elements
  *Using <img src=""> tags with alt text to add images
